Don't worry about this Windows Defender popup, because you have downloaded a file from an external source, so Windows Defender will say that running this app can expose you to risk

Just click on "more info" and the "run" button

When you run the installer, it will download the necessary packages on requirements.txt and then start the program

This is the main GUI of the program.

### Functions & Controls

#### - help
If you type "help" in the program console, you will be shown all the possible commands with their descriptions.

#### - formatusb
After typing "formatusb" the program will ask you in what type of file you want format your USB/Hard drive

I purposely chose a non-existent hard drive, but if I had written D: it would have formatted the USB stick with the FAT32 file type

#### - format
If you type "format" the program will ask you what folder

After choosing the folder the program will ask if you are sure about this option

If you press enter or any key the program will end the script 

But if you type "Yes/yes" the program will format your computer
