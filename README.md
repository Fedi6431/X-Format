Don't worry about this Windows Defender popup, because you have downloaded a file from an external source, so Windows Defender will say that running this app can expose you to risk

Just click on "run" button

When you run the installer, it will download the necessary packages on requirements.txt and then start the program

I purposely chose a non-existent hard drive, but if I had written D: it would have formatted the USB stick with the FAT32 file type
